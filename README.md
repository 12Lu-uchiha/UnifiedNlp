UnifiedNlp
==========
The next generation NetworkLocationProvider, based on plugins

Installation
------------
Release builds may be found on the [release page](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/releases).
Installation requires a rooted system.

### Android 4.4 - 5.0 (KitKat / Lollipop)
Download `NetworkLocation.apk`, copy it to `/system/priv-app/NetworkLocation.apk` and reboot. The following shell commands will do the job:

	adb root && adb remount
	adb push path/to/NetworkLocation.apk /system/priv-app/NetworkLocation.apk
	adb reboot

### Android 4.2 - 4.3 (Jelly Bean)
Download `LegacyNetworkLocation.apk`, copy it to `/system/app/NetworkLocation.apk` and reboot. The following shell commands will do the job:

	adb root && adb remount
	adb push path/to/LegacyNetworkLocation.apk /system/app/NetworkLocation.apk
	adb reboot

### Android 2.3 - 4.1 (Gingerbread / Honeycomb / Ice Cream Sandwich / Jelly Bean)
These releases are no longer actively supported and might be unstable. Additionally, most backends require a newer Android version.

However the LegacyNetworkLocation (instructions for Android 4.2) usually works quiet well.

Usage
-----
UnifiedNlp as it does not provide any features, but acts as a middleware for multiple backends.

Here is an open list of backends for geolocation known to me:

-	[AppleWifiNlpBackend](https://github.com/microg/AppleWifiNlpBackend) - backend that uses Apple's service to resolve wifi locations
-	[OpenWlanMapNlpBackend](https://github.com/microg/OpenWlanMapNlpBackend) - backend that uses OpenWlanMap.org to resolve user location.
-	[LocalGSMLocationProvider](https://github.com/rtreffer/LocalGSMLocationProvider) - Local opencellid based location provider backend
-	[LocalGSMBackend](https://github.com/n76/Local-GSM-Backend) - Local location provider for gsm cells with separate database file (lacells.db)
-	[PersonalWifiBackend](https://github.com/n76/wifi_backend) - Local location provider for WiFi APs using on-phone generated database.
-	(...) Create issue or pull request to extend this list :)

The following is an open list of backends for (reverse) geocoding:

-   [NominatimGeocoderBackend](https://github.com/microg/NominatimGeocoderService)

After installing a backend, you can use UnifiedNlp by activating network-based geolocation in Settings->Location. 
Since KitKat, you need to select any mode but "device only", on older Android version this setting is called "Wi-Fi & mobile network location" 
(ignore any misleading texts saying this is for Google's location service, you don't have Google's service installed but UnifiedNlp :smile:) 

As part of a custom ROM
-----------------------
UnifiedNlp can be build as part of Android when building an Android ROM from source.

Add the repo to your (local) manifest.xml and extend the `PRODUCT_PACKAGES` variable with `NetworkLocation` for KitKat and `LegacyNetworkLocation` for Jelly Bean.

Backend-development
-------------------
Take a look at the API documentation in `/api/README.md`. You might also be interested in the sample backends in `/sample/`

Building
--------
To be build with Android Build System using `make UnifiedNlp`, `make LegacyNetworkLocation` or `make NetworkLocation`
